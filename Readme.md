Assignment 2

Complilation Instructions

The following commands will compile and run the program (Note: Do not include the '$' - this just marks that 
    you should enter these commands in the terminal):

    $ make all
    $ ./bin/assignment2

Once the program reaches Q2 - it will prompt you for the x and y coordinates of the points separately. Enter the values and give it several seconds to run. The brute force algorithm takes several seconds to complete running.

Note: The program may pause for several seconds - it is not frozen, this is just because the 
    brute force functions are still running
